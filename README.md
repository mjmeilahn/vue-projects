# Vue Projects
One repo that contains a list of my Vue pet projects.

1. Basics - binding data, computed properties, HTML event listeners, watchers

2. Monster Slayer Game - Interactive DOM game combining Vue state with CSS display. Options to Attack, Heal or Give Up. Monster will always Attack - in the future might have Monster heal itself depending on probability factors.
