# Vue Projects
One repo that contains a list of my Vue pet projects.

1. Basics - binding data, computed properties, HTML event listeners, watchers

2. Monster Slayer Game - Interactive DOM game combining Vue state with CSS display. Options to Attack, Heal or Give Up. Monster will always Attack - in the future might have Monster heal itself depending on probability factors.

3. Vue CLI - Basic setup using Vue's CLI, Webpack & SASS. Exploring folder structure and optimizations for deployment to a server.

4. Component Basics - Creating reusable components, understanding Global vs. Private components. Shared vs. private state among components.

5. Component Communication - Updating sibling components from different parent via an event bus service. Exploring props through strict and non-strict type-checking.

6. Advanced Components - Understanding Dynamic Components, their lifecycles and default state upon creation, slots, keep-alive, and component keywords.
